# Electron-builder-latest-yml-action

This is my first time to build a project with neovim(vim).
So it could be some little mistakes in format or other things.

## What's this doing?

sha512 the artifacts and write the info to lastest.yml(or latest_mac.yml for mac, lastest_linux.yml for Linux)
